## .emacs.d
My .emacs configuration, in a state of constant flux.

## Packages to look at:
 * robe - code navigation, doc and completion, for rails?

## Need to document how to use with (cask)[https://github.com/cask/cask]
  * Need to make sure the to the cask.el file is correct. <path-to-cask> will vary depending on how you installed Cask: if you installed via the curl method, it is likely to be ~/.cask; if you installed via Homebrew, it is likely to be /usr/local/Cellar/cask/<version>.
