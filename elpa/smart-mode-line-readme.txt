Smart Mode Line is a mode-line format that aims to be easy to
read from small to large monitors by using a prefix feature and
smart truncation.

Your mode-line will be color coded, smartly truncated (if you
want), easily customizable, and will have a few extra fancy
features like file path prefixes and minor mode filtering.

Instructions:

INSTALLATION

Make sure "smart-mode-line.el" is in your load path, then place
this code in your .emacs file:
    (require 'smart-mode-line)
    (if after-init-time (sml/setup)
      (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'sml/setup))

DESCRIPTION

Its main features are:

1) Color coded:
Highlights the most important information for you
(buffer name, modified state, line number). Don't
like the colors? See item 4)!

2) Fixed width (if you want):
Lets you set a maxium width for the path name and mode
names, and truncated intelligently (truncates the
directory, not the buffer name).

3) Fancy features:
Prefix feature saves a LOT of space. e.g. "~/.emacs.d/"
is translated to ":ED:" in the path (open a file inside
this folder to see it in action). Long path names you
are commmonly working on are displayed as short
abbreviations. Set your own prefixes to make best use
of it (by configuring `sml/replacer-regexp-list'). Mousing
over the abbreviated path will show you the full
path. See below for examples.

Hidden-modes feature saves even more space. Select
which minor modes you don't want to see listed by
customizing the `sml/hidden-modes' variable. This will
filter out the modes you don't care about and unclutter
the modes list (mousing over the modes list still shows
the full list).

4) Very easy to configure:
All fonts are in the `smart-mode-line-faces'
customization group, and all other options are in
`smart-mode-line'. Just run `sml/customize' and see
what's in there. If you feel anything is missing send me
an e-mail.

5) Compatible with `battery-display-mode':
Just turn the mode on to have the battery level
displayed. sml uses a very short syntax for the
battery. Only the battery level is displayed (with no %
symbol), and green/red font means charging/discharging
respectively.

VARIABLES

All variables can be edited by running `sml/customize', and the
documentations are mostly self explanatory, I list here only the
most important ones.

*Note:* We use an `after-init-hook` in the installation because we
need sml/setup to override the theme's colors for the mode-line. See
the documentattion on the `sml/override-theme` variable for more
information.

	`sml/shorten-directory' and `sml/shorten-modes'
		Setting both of these to t garantees a fixed width mode-line
		(directory name and modes list will be truncated to fit).  To
		actually define the width, see below.

	`sml/name-width' and `sml/mode-width'
		Customize these according to the width of your Emacs
		frame.  I set them to 40 and 'full respectively, and the
		mode-line fits perfectly when the frame is split in two even
		on my laptop's small 17" monitor.

	`sml/replacer-regexp-list'
		This variable is a list of (REGEXP REPLACEMENT) that is used
		to parse the path.  The replacements are applied
		sequentially.  This allows you to greatly abbreviate the path
		that's shown in the mode-line.  If this abbreviation is of
		the form ":SOMETHING:", it is considered a prefix and get's
		a different color (you can change what's considered a prefix
		by customizing `sml/prefix-regexp').

		For example, if you do a lot of work on a folder called
		"~/Dropbox/Projects/In-Development/" almost half the
		mode-line would be occupied just by the folder name, which
		is much less important than the buffer name.  But, you can't
		just hide the folder name, since editting a file in
		"~/Dropbox/Projects/In-Development/Source" is VERY different
		from editting a file in "~/Dropbox/Projects/Source".  By
		setting up a prefix for your commonly used folders, you get
		all that information without wasting all that space.  In this
		example you could set the replacement to ":ProjDev:" or just
		":InDev:", so the path shown in the mode-line will be
		":ProjDev:Source/" (saves a lot of space without hiding
		information).

		Here go some more useful examples:

	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^~/Dropbox/Projects/In-Development/"	":ProjDev:"))
	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^~/Documents/Work/"			":Work:"))

	;; Added in the right order, they even work sequentially:
	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^:DB:Documents"			":DDocs:"))
	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^~/Dropbox/"				":DB:"))
	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^:Git:\\(.*\\)/src/main/java/"	":G/\\1/SMJ:"))
	(add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '("^~/Git-Projects/"			":Git:"))
